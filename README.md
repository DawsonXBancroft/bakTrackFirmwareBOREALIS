# bakTrackFirmwareBOREALIS
The default bakTrack firmware for BOREALIS interns. Made for someone who had little experience with CCS, Git, etc.

## How to Use
### The Easy (Boring) Way
Download the file by clicking code and downloading the .zip file. Extract it and copy the source code into a new CCS project. Make sure to change the optimizations and ensure that the target processor is set to the MSP430FR2355.

### The Harder (Fun) Way
Use Git Bash, Git Desktop, etc. to clone this repository and open the directory in CCS. You may have to ensure that the target processor is set correctly and that optimizations are turned off.
